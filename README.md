## Purpose of the software includes:
- Which type of software development process to use.
 - Agile  

- Why did you choose this type (waterfall vs. agile)?

  Because the use of Agile makes it easier and more efficient to modify problematic parts and add new features in the future and to better adapt to changes in user needs, improving the quality of the game and user satisfaction

   Cater to young to middle-aged people who like casual puzzle games, have a certain income and education level, and use smartphones or computers

## The likely use of your software (i.e., target market)

- Connect the Dots is a pattern matching puzzle game. There are many forms. You just need to connect two identical cards with three or less straight lines to eliminate them. The rules are simple and easy to learn. The game is fast-paced with clear and lovely graphics for careful players. Rich props and public modes have been added to enhance the competitiveness of the game; multi-styled maps allow players to find challenges and fun at all levels of play.

## The uses of connection points are as follows:

1. Improve children's attention, observation, memory and reflexes.
2. Exercise players' hand speed, eyesight, strategy and mentality.
3. Learn some cultural knowledge, such as Japanese variant characters, architectural signs, etc..
4. Pass the boring time and relax .


## Algorithm
This RandomRectangle() method implements a game interface that generates a random pattern and contains some algorithms. Specifically: 

- Create a list containing the numbers 1-50, ensuring that each number has a matching pair in the list.
- Shuffle the list to generate a random sequence of numbers.
- Create an interface consisting of 100 squares, each containing a random pattern.
- Implement the reaction of a square when clicked by the mouse, including obtaining the clicked square object, making the first clicked square semi-transparent, checking if the IDs of the two squares are the same, and

These algorithms mainly involve knowledge of data structures and algorithms, such as lists, random numbers, and loops. Overall, the algorithmic complexity of this code is not high, mainly consisting of algorithms with O(n) or O(1) complexity.
